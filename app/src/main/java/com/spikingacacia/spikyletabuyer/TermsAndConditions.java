                "When registering on the Platform, Users must choose a username and password. Both the username and the password are strictly confidential, personal and non-transferable. In order to increase the security of accounts, ORDER recommends that users do not use the same login credentials as on other platforms. If a User uses the same login credentials as on other platforms, ORDER will be unable to guarantee the security of the account or ensure that the User is the only person logging into his/her profile.\n" +

Therefore, since ORDER and its payment platform are proactive in the protection of Users through the use of appropriate security measures, if a User fails to inform ORDER of the missing card, ORDER will not be liable for any fraudulent use thereof that may be made by third parties on the User’s account. ORDER suggests that Users report any theft, robbery or suspected misuse of their credit card to the police.\n" +
